Hello!

To be able to run the application on your mobile phone please change the file:<br/><br/> **src/utils/config **
<br/><br/><br/>
the HOST_API is currently = http://localhost:3000
change it to the address the router gave to your pc and the PORT the server is running - defaults to 3000.<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
Thanks :)

<br/><br/><br/>
